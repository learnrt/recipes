Ingredients:
- 3 cups of idli rice
- 1 cup of urad dal
- a few fenugreek seeds, 1 tsp or less (optional)
- 2 Tbsps of tapioca pearls/sabudana (optional)

Directions: 
1. Wash and soak the urad dal and rice separately. Soaking the urad dal for an hour might be sufficient, but the rice should be soaked for 4 hours or more. The optional ingredients are soaked along with the rice.
2. Grind the urad dal in a grinder or food processor/mixie to a fluffy thick batter. Do not add too much water, the batter must not be runny.
3. Now grind the rice in a grinder or food processor till it forms a batter. When you rub the batter between the thumb and index finger, it must feel coarse like it had semolina granules it. Again keep in mind that it must not be too watery.
4. Now mix the two batters evenly. The final batter's consistency must be thick enough for it to not flow easily when poured from a ladle, rather it should fall off, "plop..plop".
5. Ferment the batter overnight, when around 25 degrees celcius, or shorter, say 5hrs when temperature is higher, say 33 degrees celcius. Place the batter in a large enough container to prevent it from overflowing. Once fermented, refrigerate it if you do not intend to use it immediately. 
6. Oil the idli plate or place a cloth on it. Pour the batter into the cups. Steam the batter for 8 minutes. Let the steamer cool for 5 minutes before opening the lid. Again let the idlis cool a little before attempting to remove them with a spoon. You can sprinkle a little cool water to make things easier.
